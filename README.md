# API Test Automation project using RestSharp, C#, and SpecFlow.
This code came from my completion of Udemy course: REST API testing using C# RestSharp and SpecFlow (https://www.udemy.com/share/103J3Y3@LoiVm2tv0rf81VKFU-GAgUjv8ghxwQvbX-tvODoNiIB4WOppoRW7vWm2-Ss03C4OKg==/)

Some amendments were made after course completion to improve on class name consistency and folder structure.

Also includes reporting NuGet package Extent Reports.
